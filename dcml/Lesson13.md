# Analyze robustness of models under camera failures

This is a *lab* lecture, in the sense that we are going to try and write code with Atif.

The plan is:

- we select a model
- we execute it on its test-set and we compute the accuracy
- we change the test-set to include the faulty images
- we measure the difference in accuracy

*Note:* this way we can measure the robustness of the model.
