# Cost management

## Some definitions

- **Costing**: determining the bare costs to deliver a project
- **Budgeting**: determining the financial needs of a project and prepare the books to monitor the expenses (and incomes)
- **Pricing**: determining how much to charge for a project
- **LCC**: Life Cycle Costing, the total cost of ownership of a project

## Software project costing

**Project cost:** the expenses needed for the project without taking into account the eventual profits. Made of direct and indirect costs.

**CES:** hierarchical structure that define the cost items

### Direct costs

- **Manpower**: the cost of the people working on the project
- **Materials and supplies**: the cost of the materials and supplies used in the project
- **Hardware and software**: the cost of the hardware and software used in the project
- **Travel and subsistence**: the cost of the travel and subsistence of the people working on the project
- **Others**: other costs that are directly attributable to the project (books, training courses, etc.)

### Indirect costs

The basic idea is that these are the expenses that are necessary to run the facility and make the project doable.

- **General overehead**: the cost of the general services that are necessary to run the facility
- **Project overhead**: the cost of the services that are necessary to run the project

### Indirect costs computation

This is the process of determining the indirect costs of a project. This can be done by allocating a flat value or a percentage value. (*Note:* the percentage used for the indirect costs can also be high, like 60% or even more).

This can be done by identifying a strategy to calculate them in respect to the total cost, or by looking at previous expenses and calculate the new ones accordingly.

### Project cost formula

$$\sum_{j=1}^{m}Hours_j*(PC_j+O_j) + \sum_{i=1}^{n}C_i$$

### Managing project costs

The project manager should always keep track of the costs of the project. In particular we want to be sure that the money that we need for a specific activities will be available when we need them and we also want to be sure that we don't terminate our budget before the end of the project.

This needs to specify a **baseline** and then manage **expense authorization** and create an expenses book.

### Expense profile

Another important thing to consider is that sometimes the cost aren't linear during a specific activity. It might be needed to spend all the budget dedicated to a specific activity in the beginning or in the end, giving us the possibility to organize our budget better.

### Expense authorization

Project and financial organization are usually divided from one another. Depending on the organization the authorization for an expense might be given by the manager only or by following a more complex workflow.

## Project pricing

There are three main methods to price a project:

- **Based on cost**: the price is determined by the cost of the production of the project
- **Based on value**: the price is determined by the value that the project brings to the customer
- **Based on competition**: the price is determined by the price of the competitors

### Selling, licensing and leasing

These three words have a meaning based on the **ownership** of the product. Software is usually **licensed** (giving the grant to use it) but other approaches might be needed in specific cases.

**leasing** is a schema in which the customer pays for the use of the product for a certain amount of time. This is usually used for hardware but can also be used for software.

### Open source and free software

Open source software is usually free to use but can be sold. The main idea is that the source code is available to everyone and can be modified by everyone. This is usually used for software that is not the core business of a company.

### Formula

$$Price = Cost + Profit$$

The project pricing based on this formula can have three main strategies:

- you fix the price: pricing to win
- you fix the costs: target costing
- you fix the profit: pricing to profit
