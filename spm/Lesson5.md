# Initiate phase

This phase starts with an analysis of the idea. The analysis is aimed at defining pros and cons of the idea.

## Start of the project

The actual starting time of a project could be not well defined. It could be a stakeholder that decides that the project must start. In other cases there might be someone inside a company that decides to put an idea on the table and can convince the others to work on his idea cause it's fitting in the market.  
In other cases there are companies that are specifically created to earn money from a person's idea. In these cases it's hard to define when the project actually starts cause you could say the project started with the idea or you could say that the project actually starts when the fundings are given (which is usually many weeks/months later).  

**Project value and risk:**  
The **value** of the project is it's main pro. The **risk** of the project is the main con (at least in the beginning).  
A risk is something that could happen, but it's not sure that it will happen. This means that all the risks should be considered, but they must also be analyzed in how probable they are to occur.  
Both **value** and **risks** can be evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively. *Note:* every project has a risk, given that if you have a project with no risks, it's most likely cause you didn't identify them yet.

### Project value:  
There are **direct** and **indirect** values.  
The first direct value that comes to mind is the actual **profit** that the project can generate (*Note:* earnings-spendings = profit).  
The **indirect** values are the ones that are not directly related to the profit. For example, a project could be started to increase the company's reputation. Another example of indirect value is the value you can generate by producing a software that enables the creation of other software.

**Sustainability:**  
this term refers to the capacity of sustaining the project and his outputs after the project ends. *I.e:* an open-source project might not be sustainable because a company might not want to give money for it cause other companies could use the project too.

**Alignment with strategic objectives:**  
this means that you must always evaluate if the project you are creating is relevant in the market and for the organization. *I.e:* if a project is about something that no one cares about, maybe it's better to drop it.

### Risks:

**Resource availability:**  
one of the first things done in a project is evaluating if the resources are available. Given that, you must always reconsider the first evaluation that you may have done cause most of the times the availability of specific resources is out of your control and might change really fast.

**Timing:**  
usually a project has a really strict time-window in which it has to be delivered. This is fine as long as you are able to fulfill the time requirements that you decided with the customer, otherwise you might incur in penalties and/or loss of reputation.  
Another reason why timing is important is that the market is always changing, delivering a product late or early might result in a loss of market share.

**Technical difficulties and Uncertainty:**  
this is derived from the fact that there are many ways to do something in a project. You usually pick one in the beginning but it has some consequences. Even if sometimes you are not responsible for certain aspect of your product cause you rely on someone else's code, you are responsible for picking it's code even if it was (apparently) bad.

**Project environment and constraints:**  
when you are creating a project you must comply with the environment you are developing it in. *I.e:* you want to publish your software in the European market, you must comply with the GDPR.

**Risk evaluation:**  
usually in projects the rule is high risk -> high reward. This means that if you are able to manage the risks of a project, you might get a higher reward, also usually the possibility of failure is directly proportional with the revenue you might be able to get.  
One of the easier things to do in order to understand if a project has a risk that we should take is to evaluate the project in terms of **costs** and **benefits**. This way of evaluating a project is not the best in many cases. *I.e:* the project makes it easy to earn revenues fast but then it's not scalable.
