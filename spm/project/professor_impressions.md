# Our basic idea

**Our basic idea:**
Creating a kitchen with complete home automation. The home automation part is not new, but the idea of having something that can also be used by disabled people could be a good add. We could have a specific part regarding models (LLP) that are trained with disabled people. (Prof. suggests that the software part for this project should be perfect and security should be a must).

**17/11/2024:**

- Focusing on the LLM part of the project.
- Focusing on the software that can be used by disabled people (U.I, U.X)
Prof. thinks it's ok, he said it's a good project. He thinks it would be easier to work on this idea instead of on the rocket idea. He thinks this project is a good idea.
