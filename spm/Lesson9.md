# Work Breakdown Structure

## General Info

A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS organizes and defines the total scope of the project. Each descending level represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.

The WBS is **deliverable-oriented**. This means that it divides the work in deliverables, which are specific objects, representing something in real life, that have to be obtained in order to arrive to the conclusion of the work.

*Example:*

*Note:* there is **NO notion of time** in the WBS. The tree that represents the WBS is not a weighted tree in any way which means that there is no need to balance the model.

## Kind of WBS

The example above shows the **tree** approach. This is not the only approach, there are many other graphical and textual option that are used to represent the **WBS**. In all the representation there is no notion of dependency other than a gather being made out of his children.

The idea behind the WBS is to start representing the work that needs to be done, it's used to define the basis. It should be able to represent the work that needs to be performed, some basic relationships but also to start defining the person needed in the project and their responsibilities.

## Basic rules

- **Everything should be in it's place** but nothing more that what's needed should be included. You should follow the **100% rule**, which means that you should include everything that is needed but nothing more than that. You should follow the **ME rule** which means that there shouldn't be any overlap. You shouldn't care about the tree being balanced.
- **The quality of a WBS is based on:**
  - **Coherence:** tasks that are in the same work package should have the same goal
  - **Coupling:** work package dependency should be minimized, so that each team can work independently
  - **Continuity:** production should be full-time to maximize efficiency
  - **Cost:** the cost of the bottom nodes of the WBS should be limited between [1 man/week, 1 man/month]

*Note:* the size of the bottom elements of the WBS isn't directly defined, but is highly dependent on the size of the project. Also usually there might be other part composing the lowest level packages of the WBS, but they might be not included in the WBS itself.

### Types of WBS

There are many ways to catalogue the WBS. For instance based on the part of the project that are based on:

- **Product WBS:** it's developed based on the product. It can start from a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) and then be transformed into a WBS.
- **Process WBS:** it's developed based on the process.
- **Hybrid WBS:** it's a mix of the two above.

Or **Organizational** and **Geographical** WBS:

- **Organizational WBS**: Higher levels are organizational units, lower levels collect the work which is under the responsibility of a unit.
- **Geographical WBS:** Higher levels are geographically distributed teams (e.g. NY team, Firenze team), lower levels collect the work under the responsibility of a team

Others: **PWBS** and **CWBS**.

### Metodologies

The two main methodologies to create a WBS are:

- **Top-down:** you start from the top and then you go down to the bottom. This is the most common approach. The main issue that could happen is to forget some part of the project.
- **Bottom-up:** you start from the bottom and then you go up to the top. This is less common but it's useful when you want to create something different from what you have designed before. The main issue is the possibility to go to in-depth and start violating the non overlapping rule.

### WBS Dictionary

The WBS dictionary is a document that describes each component in the WBS. It could look something like this:

The dictionary is heavily dependent on the project and the company, so it's not possible to define a standard one. Also depending on the dimensions of the company it might be more or less wide.
