# Feasibility study

This document is used to formally authorize a project and link it to organization's goals. This study doesn't produce a very specific output, each manager could produce something different than the other.

This part is fundamental in order to allow the manager of a company to finance our project.

Goals of a Feasibility Study:

- Identify:
  - the project goals
  - the project constraints
- Assess value and risks (using the techniques above)
- Ensure the project lines up with
  - the customer objectives
  - the performing organization objectives
- Demonstrate that the project goals
  - can be achieved respecting the quality, cost, and time
constraints

**Example of what a Feasibility study usually contains:**

- **Statement of work** describing what the project will accomplish
- **Business objectives** it's output and business model (this part can be very long cause it must be really precise and detailed for those who read it to understand your project)
- **Project budget** nothing too specific or detailed in this first presentation (but still something that must make sense and be realistic)
- **Project milestones** a schedule of the project but not too detailed (*I.e:* month 3: A, month 6: B, month 9: C, etc.)
- **Stakeholder analysis**
- **Risk analysis** (*I.e:* I have a lot of competitors that could perform better than me, the challenges that we have to face are too hard, etc.)
- **Alternatives and make/buy decision** in this part you should investigate if someone else is already proposing something similar to what you want to develop. In addition to that you should also make decision on what you want to develop and what you want to take from others. In our academic example we should investigate but we can just say that our project is fine as long as it has some specific aspects that differ from what already exists
- **Evaluation of the alternatives** found in the step above.

*Note:* this document can be useful for the client the organization and also the project manager. We should use everything that it's already been presented in the course to make the document as good as possible.

## The project approval process

The main phases of this process are:

- Identify a project manager
- he does the feasibility study
- he presents the feasibility study to the organization in order to be authorized to start the project
- the organization decides if the project is feasible or not
- if the project is feasible the manager can go into the planning phase.

If the proposal is rejected at first the manager can try to improve it and present it again. Also another important thing to consider is that the client could also ask to change something in the project already in this phase.

**For our project:** document to send to the professor before the 31st of October.
