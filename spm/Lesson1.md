W# Introduction: motivations and Challenges

**Motivations:**
There are many courses about the technical parts of software development but there are few about the correct process to follow to develop a software. That part is as important as the other in real life.
*Example:* consider working on a project, you know all the technicalities but:
- you end up having no time to do the tests
- you are working on a group project and you have no way to manage the concurrent working
- you are working in a group and the other users are not trained properly.

**Challenges:**
- the product is intangible
- the product is flexible (which might also be an advantage, but it must be handled properly)
- the product is usually a one-off
- the development process is flexible (which again might be an advantage but finding the best way becomes hard)
- size and complexity required are increasing as year pass (in these days software requires the use of many libraries and components)
- sometimes human lives depend on your software.

**Complexity:**
Over the time complexity increased exponentially. (See Nasa projects)

# What is a project

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result. (PMBOK definition)

**Characteristics of a project:**
A project is temporary. It is predefined when it starts but also when it ends.
The results of a project might not be temporary but the project always is.
*Example:* production of a car is not a project cause it's done everyday. Ideating a new model of a car is a project.

Defining the starting point is easy. The team decides the first day from which the team will start working on that specific project. Defining the end is easy in theory because the group can decide when they want to stop working on a project. In reality that date might be very wrong
A project might be sponsored by an institution. In that case the starting and the ending are defined by them. 

**Project phases:**
Initiate -> Plan -> Execute -> Close
                 -> Monitor ->
The work is not linear, each part takes a different kind of work and sometimes certain parts are more work intensive than others (starting takes less work, most of the work is done once everyone settles down). Execute and monitor are the most intensive parts. In the initiate part only few people work, same can be said for the planning part
