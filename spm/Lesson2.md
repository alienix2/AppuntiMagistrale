# Review of other lesson
**Normal business:**
the normal business of a company is the operational work needed to do it's normal business. 
*I.e:* production of a car is normal business, creation of a new type is a new project.

**Characteristics of a project:**
- **Temporary:** it always has a beginning and an end. The existence of an end is NOT optional. There must be an end to the specific project for it to be called one. (*Note:* that's not usually the case for operational work, that is instead meant to last as long as possible);
- **Unique:**
- **Resource Constrained**
- **Progressive elaboration**

**Project's phases:**
Initiate -> Plan -> Execute and Monitor -> Close
Most of the work is located in the Execute and Monitor phase. In this phase there are people working on the project and people monitoring how the project is going (and think of ways to ensure that the project is going well).

#Unique

When we talk about a project being unique, we mean many different things:
- your project responds directly to the problem of the customer. Your project is usually specifically tailored for a client.
- the project can be a product, service or result. That means that it can be something physical but it might not. (*I.e:* a domain specific language created to fit the needs of a customer has nothing physical) An example of a result is something like knowledge written in documents or even just acquired by the customer (*I.e:* a company hires you to teach all the employee the use of a specific software).
- the project **MUST** be something that **doesn't** already exist in the market, it has to be something new, otherwise we're talking about marketing.

**Resource Constrained:**
What we mean here is that of course our project isn't allow to use infinite resource (*I.e:* you don't have infinite hardware or storage space or money). This means that sometimes you must think of a solution to the problem which is **NOT** the best.

One of the most common mistakes made when creating a project is trying to reach something unreachable. The **project manager** has it's very first work in analyzing that the project is feasible with the resources available.

**Progressive elaboration:**
When you start with the realization of a project, you usually take some choices. That makes it so there are less and less choices to take later on.
*I.e:* If I have to start a new software project I might consider using any programming language but once I decided it I must stick with libraries and modules available in that specific language. Even more, if I choose to use a specific library I'm constraining even more my choices cause every other library I wanna use must integrate well with the first one.

The meaning of progressive elaboration is that I must always check if what I'm doing is right cause if I have to go back a lot of steps, I'm going to lose lots of money and time. The more I take the wrong route the more time and money I will have to waste to go back to the right one.

**Project management Context:**
- **Subprojects:** usually if a project is really big it must be divided into multiple small projects. Subprojects are also referred as project
- **Program management:** this is a set of **related** projects that are managed in a coordinated way in order to achieve something. *I.e:* Nasa has many separate projects, from hardware to software to physical training and mental health, but they all cooperate to achieve space missions.
- **Portfolios:** collections of projects not related with one another.

**Operation work vs projects:**
*I.e:* Cooking dinner (with a recipe you already know) -> operational work
Thought process of a chef ideating a delicacy -> project
Building a care -> operational work
Designing a car -> project
Writing a paper -> project (if we think of a scientific paper) or operational work (if you're just collecting other's ideas)
Developing a software system -> project (if it is something new) or operational work (if it's something already did to other clients)

# Application Development

**Goal:** developing an Application

**Types of application development:**
- **One-offs:** specifically created for a client. This is the type requiring more work but usually it's also the most fun for the programmer. A client might ask for this type of application but usually if creating a new custom software is not needed it is better to avoid it. These kind of projects are rare nowadays cause software is often written to apply in many different cases.
A specific type of one-off is a project developed for an institution (*I.e:* European Union). In that case if you don't finish the work in time you'll usually get no money.
- **Off-the-shelf:** created to fulfill requirements of a set of users. That's something that has become really common today. The difference between these projects and the one-offs is that in this case you decide what you want the customers to be able to do, you decide the goals. That's the opposite of what happens in the one off, in which the customer decides things you must implement. The main problem in this kind of projects is the possibility of failure if your software doesn't fit any user (or too few users).
- **Customized Off-the-shelf:** something that is standardized but needs to be adapted to be used in a specific company. This is probably the most common type nowadays. You take something you (or someone else) already created and customize it to fit the needs of a specific customer. Usually you have more constrains than in a one-off.

**Suggestions for the project for the final exam:**
In this course it's most likely that most of us will work on application development. It is very important in that case that we think about which of the 3 types above we are looking to develop. Some of the ideas that come to mind might not need a one-off in which case the software shouldn't be developed as a one-off.
The budget is really tied with the type of the app developed. We cannot think about selling the application at a price of 500 per copy if it has no value or is intended to be bought by everybody (like an app on the play store).
If you choose to think about a project which requires a lot of money you must consider that someone must belling to pay you.

# Other development project cases

**Process and system re-engineering:**
**Goal:** change the way the operational work is carried out.

You start with a large system and you need to analyze the situation and elaborate a solution for the current problems in the system.
Usually you need the introduction of an ERP system. 
*I.e:* you need to improve the system of a university

**System integration services:**
**Goal:** automating the information flow among the system of an organization.
**types of integration:**
- **Horizontal:** integrate systems which are performing the same kind of things
- **Vertical:** integrate systems which are automating different steps of a procedure.

**Consulting services:** *Example:* a company needs to contact another to teach their employee. A company contacts another regarding a problem they face and a theoretical solution.
*Real case example:* there is an industry producing washing machine, nowadays there are multiple programs in a washing machine. You want to integrate AI in your washing machine. You already have the code of the AI and also technicians that can write code.You just need another company to teach your technicians how to use AI frameworks and models.

**Installation and training services:** there are cases in which that is actually a project (other times it's not a project because of the definition we gave before)

# Group practical test

**Detailed rules:**
- the practical test should be carried by 2-3 students.
- can be done alone but it's not recommended
- each person should do something and each person should be quoted for what he did in the project
- more people means more work to be done by the Group
- the project must encompass all the phases of SPM excluding the SW part (slides are wrong here)
- the project topic should be proposed by the group to the teacher. He will try to guide us into modifying the project so that it fits the course topics and the number of people involved in the project. Also he will try to help us understand if what we are trying to do is to ambitious or is straight up wrong in terms of costs or time.
- start thinking about an idea. **Next week we will already start discussing about the idea**. (It must be something that actually is a project and it must also be something that is big and that we can discuss about)

# Projects and their environment

A project **Stakeholder** is an individual or an organization actively involved in a project or whose interest are affected by our project execution or completion **(positively or negatively)**.
It's very important to understand who are the stakeholders because they are interested in the success of the project (or the failure). *I.e:* you are developing an app to help blind people going shopping at the supermarket. Your main stakeholders are the blind people. There might be someone else developing something similar which will be a stakeholder that will want you to **fail**. There might be some companies developing sensors that would like you to use their devices in a successful way, they are stakeholders too.

**The players:**
- they may have different types of influence (small, big etc.)
- they may play different roles
- they may have positive or negative influence
- they may be hard to identificate
- they might be someone who doesn't step in, and that might influence you in a bad way

**Types of stakeholders:**
- project manager
- project team
- project sponsor
- performing organizations
- partners (complex projects usually need partners cause you need people with knowledge that nobody has in your company)
- client
- rest, affected by the project output

**Another classification:**
- **Internal:** project team members and project management team
- **In between:** customer sponsor etc.
- **External:** partners

It's not always easy to identify the stakeholders.
*Real case example:* I have to build a bridge connecting and island to mainland.
Obvious stakeholders are:
- the company that sells the materials
- the authority that needs to authorize the projects
- the company that has the tractors, workers etc
- the greenland autorithy (checks if it ruins the view)
- many more

The **Project manager** is the role that someone who follows this course is trying to learn how to do.
First of all you need to manage the project but in particular you must also manage the stakeholders so that they are satisfied and happy with the project. A project manager must always know what the others expect from him.
*I.e:* if you want to work for the European Union, you must talk with the people paying you and convince them to pay you, otherwise you will have no money.

**Some skills needed** to be a good project manager: communication skills, predisposition to risk, goal orientation, leadership, thinking outside the box, leadership, style, common sense, correctness etc.
Some of the skills are straightforward some others are hard to understand and have. Correctness for instance means that you shouldn't try to promise something that you can't actually offer.
