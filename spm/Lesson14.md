# Resource allocation and Resource leveling

## Simplified process

**Inputs:** the plan, the project team, the delivery dates

**Resource allocation:** the process of assigning the resources to the tasks

**Constraints:** according to availability and needs (being careful not to over-allocate the resources)

*Note:* if there is no solution that satisfies all the constraints we need to vary some hypothesis like increasing the team size or relaxing some constraints.

*Note:* we can try to use some optimization algorithms to find the best solution if just trying this naif approach doesn't produce the expected results. We will see them in the next lecture

## Resource usage

In this case the resource usages can be analyzed based on 3 aspects:

- **manpower**: the amount of work that can be done by a person in a certain amount of time
- **equipment**:  number of items necessary in a certain amount of time
- **materials**: the amount of materials necessary (usually consumed) in a certain amount of time

**Overallocation:** a situation where a resource is used more than its maximum capacity
