# More on formalizing project goals

## Project objectives

The objectives should be written in a smart way:

- **Specific:** what do you want to achieve?
- **Measurable:** how do you know you have achieved it? This should be easy to understand, meaning that you should put a specific task that should be done and a time.
- **Achievable:** is it possible to achieve this objective?

### Moscow

Moscow is composed of 4 different categories:

- **Must:** these are the objectives that are mandatory to achieve the project
- **Should:** these are the objectives that are important but not mandatory
- **Could:** these are the objectives that are not mandatory but could be nice to have. In this part I shouldn't specify too many goals cause people who read this part shouldn't give us money for a project that we could (or couldn't) make. In this part we should specify things that we might not be able to do and that would make the project nicer or better (but not make the project as a whole)
- **Won't:** these are the objectives that are not going to be achieved. We are thinking about things that might be nice in general, but in our specific case we know that we are never going to achieve them and we're not trying. This is to make sure that people don't think that we are going to implement things that we aren't even trying to implement. (*I.e:* you need to implement a new software for a public administration. You don't want to be the one who needs to also install the software in the actual servers, so you specify in this section that you aren't going to perform the installation. In this case we don't want the client to be unsatisfied just for the missing final step so we better be sure that the client understands the won't part)

*Note:* in the real world the quality of the project is really based on an evaluation of a project manager on your previous work. This means that if he gives your project an **excellent** evaluation, another project manager (or the same) is more prone to assign you a new project.

**Important things to note:**  
in the **M** part you should always include things that you are sure you are able to control in full. (*I.e:* if you write that your software will have 1000 user in the first month, that isn't something that you can know and therefore is really easy to be wrong by writing it and therefore to have a failing project. If you write that the user base will increase in the first months and it actually does you are being more realistic and the project can be a success even if you don't reach the 1000 users mark).

### Assumptions and constraints

**Assumptions** are conditions which are considered to be true but might actually not be in fact. Usually the project manager cannot assure about the assumptions but some stakeholder can. *I.e:* you put as a goal the increase in the performance of a system but if you rely on a stakeholder to develop something in order for you to do so, then if he isn't able to fulfill his part you won't able to match your goal.

**Constraints** are known limitations of the project. These are a set of things that you know your project isn't able to fulfill with a motivation of why you aren't able to fulfill them.

## Project outputs

The **outputs** define what the project will accomplish and when, in particular they are made out of:

- **Milestones:** a very significant event in the project. They are usually critical points and they are needed at review or delivery times. Another important thing to note is that sometimes they are tied to constraints that we cannot control

- **Deliverables:** a unique measurable and verifiable work product. Usually in a Gantt project they are used to interconnect tasks.

## Project roster

The **project roster** is just a list of people participating in the project. In the list there should be informations about the roster such as their personal informations and contacts.

This list is used by the project manager to understand who are the stakeholders and how to deal with them. It allows allows him to define the better way that allows the stakeholder to communicate between them.

This also allows to avoid wasting of time by having direct contacts inside each company that you need to interact with.
