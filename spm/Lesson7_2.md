# Formalizing project goals

With this part we enter the **Plan** phase (ending the **initiate** phase).

In this part we need to define in specific which (and who) are the resources and how they should be used.

## Identify the goals

This means that we need to determine the **scope** of the project. Even if it might seem easy it's really important to decide what it's part of our project and what is not. The project goals are formalized in the very beginning but they must be always to check to verify that they are being followed during the whole project.

A well formalized goal allows us to understand if it's being respected or not. The definition of the goals is started in the feasibility study but is continued throughout the whole life of the project.

### Goals and Requirements

Requirements and goals are close but they are not the same thing. Starting from the goals we can define the **technical requirements**. The main difference between the two is the abstraction level. The goals don't specify how one can achieve them.  
*Example:* I want to reduce pollution, I can think of a goal as reducing pollution, whereas I can think of a requirement as the max time that I want my sensors to perform their evaluation on the environment
