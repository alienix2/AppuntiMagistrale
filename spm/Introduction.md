**Goal of the course:**
giving an introduction to software project management. The discipline is very broad so it's just an introduction to the discipline.
A sound project management is one of the top reason why software projects fail or succeed.

The focus is **NOT PROGRAMMING**.

Software project management is a part of project management. The second shares many similarities with the first. The second is also usually dependent on the first.
Evaluating the quality of a software is not so easy. Also another challenge is that in a software there are many components and each should be singularly evaluated.
Another difficulty is making the project coherent with what a client asked, sometimes the client doesn't even know what he wants. Also software is usually extendable which means that you could adapt a software to multiple clients (it's a benefit but it might not be the best sometimes).

**Actual contents:** (*bonus* might not be covered)
- Basic concepts
- Managing goals, time and cost
- Pricing
- *Bonus* managing changes, risks, quality
- *Bonus* managing people and organizing communication

The lectures will also have practical lessons which is why it is known how much of the bonus parts will be covered, it depends on the time that it's needed to do the practical part.

**Text book:** introduction to Software Project Management (Adolfo Villafiorita). (Also the slides are kind of sufficient though).

**Actual time:** Tuesday 8:35-10:15, Thursday: 14:10-16:30

**Exam for attending students:**
*Practical test:* group project
*In itinere interviews:* presentations during the course

**For non attending:** same but there is a written test instead of the *in itinere interviews**

**Group project:**
Carried out in group (2-4 people). The project must encompass the initial SPM phase. The topic proposed by the group. At the end must deliver documentation and a presentation. There will be a fixed date in which documentations must be submitted
*Note:* single project is acceptable but not recommended cause it's not really adherent to reality.
