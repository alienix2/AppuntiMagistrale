# Technique to asses value and risks

## Payback period

is the time it takes to recover the investment. It's a good indicator of the project's profitability.

## Return on investment ROI

ROI measures how much we get back for every dollar invested. It calculates the average annual profit and then transform it to a percentage of the total investment.

### Discounted cash flow/inflation

A thing to always consider is the fact that the value of the money decreases over time (**inflation**). In particular: $Discount factor = \frac{1}{(1+i)^n}$

## Net present value

**Net present value (NPV)** is a financial metric that represents the difference between the present value of cash inflows and outflows over a period of time. It is used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.

The main good point of using NPV is that it allows to determine a more accurate profit-loss data. The main bad points of NPV is that it uses a fixed discount rate and that it favors shorter term projects. This is true because this indicator allows you decide if your project is good today. *Note:* you cannot think of realizing something that is good today in 4 years.

## Score matrices

The value of a project in this phase is calculated in a really rough way. Using a score matrix allows to evaluate qualitative aspects in a structured way. Values in a score matrix can be binary or a number. The **weight** measures how important a factor is for the decision
*Example:*

The main advantages of this approach is that it's simple and allows for more standardization and objectivity when making decisions. The main disadvantages are the fact that sometimes it's just a long list of useless information and the fact that different factors have the same importance if a weight matrix is not used.

## SWOT analysis

This strategy was created by Albert Humphrey in the 60s. It's a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify **strengths**, **weaknesses**, **opportunities**, and **threats** related to business competition or project planning. This is usually represented with a 2x2 matrix.

Example of each part:

- **Strengths:** Competences, selling points, etc.
- **Weaknesses:** disadvantages, methodology, timing (too tight maybe), capability gaps (your employees aren't able to do what you want yet)
- **Opportunities:** market trends, weakness of the competitors
- **Threats:** new competitors, sustainability, market trends

## Stakeholder analysis

**Goal:** understand who are the stakeholder and how they influence your project.

There are many different techniques to identify stakeholders, in particular the most used organizes them into a 2x2 matrix that matches **power** (low -> high) and **interest** (negative -> positive). In this way it's easy to decide how to deal with every single stakeholder (*I.e:* there is a stakeholder with high power and positive interest, you must try to satisfy his needs cause otherwise the project will end badly).

**Note:** all of the above should be included in the feasibility study for our group projects.
