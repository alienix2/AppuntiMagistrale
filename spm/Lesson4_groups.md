## Group activities (Matteo, Mohamed, Shahzeb, Piumi)

## Comments on all the groups

**Group 1:**

- an app for accomodation that is similar for couch surfing with credits (Prof. Strongly suggests to use blockchain).
- an app for mental health management. (Prof. suggests something about the use of machine learning).

**Group 2:**

- social network to connect people that want to travel together. Also something like blablacar (car-sharing). They didn't think about how to monetize the project. (Prof. suggests that they could also monetize on the idea by selling the idea so some big company).

**Group 3:**

- an app to connect university and companies. They plan to sell the app to the companies. (Prof. says that this kind of thing already exists and also shows an example).

**Group 4:**

- a platform for university students to sell/buy notes. It could be structured so that professor. Can also participate in the platform. (Prof. makes it clear that professor cannot actually sell their things outside of the university)

**Group 5:**

- Creating a kitchen with complete home automation. The home automation part is not new, but the idea of having something that can also be used by disabled people could be a good add. We could have a specific part regarding models (LLP) that are trained with disabled people. (Prof. suggests that the software part for this project should be perfect and security should be a must).
- Rocket (maybe a satellite would be better) that con go into space and collect data about the space. (Prof. says to think about the software aspects, not only about the engineering).
Note that we should focus on the software side not about the engineering part.

**Group 6:**

- Idea very close to what we proposed. It's about some kind of satellite that goes into space and collects data. (Prof. starts talking about the sponsors and the fact that maybe it would be hard to finance this kind of project).

**Group 7:**

- Software to manage electric car management. People can give the car to other people to use.
