*Example:* smart grid infrastructure.

There is no real single solution to correctly create and evaluate a system of systems. There are approaches that can help.

- first part about terminology followed by some examples and something more practical methodologies and design construction.
- second part about modeling and analysis. Evaluating a system (reliability, availability etc.).

**First part:** 28h

**Exam (ONLY FOR THE FIRST PART):**
