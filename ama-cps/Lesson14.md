# MDE application

One of the first application of MDE is **code generation**, that's also the main one.

There are two main types of code generation:

- **Dumb:** the code generator is only able to generate simple classes
- **Smart:** the code generator is able to generate something more complex, including UI to integrate with the generated classes

The smart code generators are usually used in the context of **DSL** (Domain Specific Language), and they have specific scenarios in which they are particularly useful.

## MDD, key elements

The key elements of MDD are:

- **Language:** the language used to describe the model
- **Execution engine:** the engine that allows to bridge the gap between the model and the final code
- **Target platform:** the platform on which the final program has to run on
