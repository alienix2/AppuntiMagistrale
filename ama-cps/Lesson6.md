# Control

In a SoSs there can be different level of control varying from no control to fully controlled.  
There are two main kinds of control:

- **Authority from the outside**: the control is given by an external entity, like a government or a company.
- **Authority from the inside**: the control is given by the members of the SoS. This means that the parts on higher levels (macro-level) control the ones in the lower level (micro-level).

Actually the authority is fundamental to have emergence. This is because if we consider the definition of emergence (given in the previous lecture) it's easy to understand that it cannot be defined if the different systems in the SoSs do not collaborate with each other.

**Simplification:**  
Usually when we consider an emergent phenomena if we conceptualize it this can lead to a simplification in the next layer.

## Macro-level and micro-level interaction

On the macro-level it might be needed to define new law for the new phenomena. The laws added between each level are called bridge laws.
*I.e:* atoms -> molecules -> cells -> medicine.

**Downward causation:** this is the name given to the phenomena that represents the fact that the whole at the higher level can impose constraint to the singles in the lower level.

As we stated before we can define emergence only if the macro-level cannot be defined only by knowing the micro-level. This is because the macro-level is more than the sum of the micro-levels in an emergence.

*Example:*

- A deadlock situation is usually defined as an emergent phenomena. This is because by looking at each of the single processes that caused the deadlock you wouldn't be able if a deadlock is going to happen for sure. In this specific case, due to non-determinism it's impossible to predict if the deadlock would happen even by looking at the system. The **Downward causation** in this specific case is the scheduling that the processes are forced to use.
- trashing in a computer system is another example of emergent phenomena. Trashing is not predictable by looking at the single processes(otherwise it will always be avoided in every process singularly)
- crash of the stock market (*more in-depth in the slides*)

*Note:* usually emergence can be defined cause of our ignorance. We are unable to predict the emergent phenomena, so it becomes emergent even if it's actually our fault not being able to identify it.
