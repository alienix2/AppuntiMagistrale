We can have appointments by contacting him or after the lecture usually.

No book is suggested, some books that are a good basis exist but they get outdated very fast. He will point at specific material in the slides. The slides are always evolving and being changed, therefore we should look for the most recent ones always.

## Structure of the course

- Preliminaries (network and protocols)
- Reconnaisance (information gathering)
- Vulnerability assessment
- Exploitation
- Post-exploitation
- Reporting

The course will have many hands-on activities, as it's fundamental to understand the theoretical part.

## Final exam

Oral examination but to access it a project must be prepared before. 1 month before the exam a target is released. The object is very vulnerable so it should be easy to find at least one vulnerability. At least one vulnerability must be found in order to access the oral exam.

In the oral examination there will also be questions about the course's arguments. If the oral examination is not sufficient **you won't pass**, so it's important to do a good oral. Having a project which is not so good but nailing the oral exam can lead to a fail.

We're expected to also kind of **cheat** for the project. The point is that in the oral exam we must know how a vulnerability can be found and exploited. Also different people can find the same vulnerability in many different ways.

The **POC** (proof of concept) that we provide, it should be replicable. There's no point in reporting **possible** vulnerabilities, we must include only the ones we were actually able to exploit.
