# Hacking and security

Hacking is not necessarily related to security. In particular it just means to "reuse technology in surprising ways". In security hacking is daily business as you are trying to understand how a system can be attacked, meaning that you can use it in a surprising way.

Hackers can be **good** or **bad** guys.

## Ethical vs Unethical hacking

The role of an ethical hacker is growing in the last days. These are the **good** guys, they usually work for the company and try to find vulnerabilities in order to resolve them, instead of using them to attack the company and get self advantage.

### Ethical hackers nowadays

In general, after a report a company is more **secure** than before. It should be noted that all the companies nowadays are already certified (ISO something) but in reality they aren't doing continuous penetration testing.

In general when we talk about an **entity** we refer to a company, a government, a person, etc. It's a generic term. The approach should be the same for all the different entities that we are working with, it's not like we can avoid doing any kind of penetration testing if the context is not critical.

The ethical hacker effectively work **against the unethical hackers**. The ethical hacker is a **white hat** hacker, while the unethical one is usually called **black hat** hacker. If the ethical hacker can find a vulnerability before the unethical hacker then the unethical one won't be able to sell the information to a third part and get money or to take down the site using that specific vulnerability.

Another important aspect is the fact that sometimes it's hard to stay in the law by doing penetration testing. This is because even if you are doing ethical hacking as a white hat hacker, then it's easy to have the need to break law in order to do a fine attack. Moreover sometimes even if you break the law you might get away with it if you are good enough.

The ethical hacker usually also works in creating the network infrastructure (installing firewalls, IDS etc.) and then tries to break it. Also every time a change is made, he will try to see if new vulnerabilities appeared.

*Note:* sometimes you might need to attack a system that you don't even know how it's written. Still from the outside you should be able to see if there's a vulnerability (or more).

**An ethical hacker never acts on her/his own, but he moves according to the agreement reached with the client who commissioned his work.**

Usually when an ethical hacker is assigned a work it must be specified what he can and what he can't use. There might be grey areas that the penetration tester might find, but he should always ask the owner what to do with them.

*Note:* if the ethical hacker breaks something in an unexpected way it's not his fault as long as he didn't access anything that he wasn't allowed to.

### What you can attack

There are many kind of attacks that can be performed by hackers. The most common ones and probably they most interesting nowadays are the one related to the network.

## Programming language

You can use any programming language to **perform an attack**. We will use Python as it's the most common one and also one of the easiest to use for someone that doesn't know any programming language.

*Note:* this doesn't mean that the system attacked must be written in Python, on the contrary we really don't care about the language used to write the system.
