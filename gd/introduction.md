## Goal of the course

Creating a videogame. Focus on the role of the **computer scientist** in the development of a game. Note that in reality there are many figure that are connected to game development that doesn't actually have to program, we won't cover that part at all.

## Why this course

In recent years game development is one of the most profitable industry in the world, in particular a lot more than some of the other most profitable ones like the movie industry.

Most of the countries have some software development companies. In particular China and USA are obviously the ones producing the most games but also having the most players playing them.

It should also be noted that there are many growing companies in Italy that are about software development. *Note:* the prof. Is open to take some suggestions for game development companies to invite doing a lecture.

Game development offers many **challenges** regarding the SW development like:

- optimization of a very complex software
- interdisciplinary competences
- specific frameworks and libraries
- specific tools

The course will focus on the theoretical part that enables to work on the practical part.

*Note:* if you have no knowledge of game development you won't become a game developer just by following this course. You will be able to develop a very simple working game.

## Content of the course

- Getting started with unity
- C# basics
- Unity environment
- Building a basic 3D game
- Basic aspects of game development
- Building a simple 2D game
- Logic, strategy and AI
- Finalization and deployment

## Exam rules

Check the slide for detailed specification.

It's basically a group project (1-4) that should be submitted alongside a short report (~4 pages). Then an oral regarding the project must be done. *Note:* when doing the project as a group, each member should have a well defined role in the project (*I.e:* one does the UI, one does the server side part, one does the AI)

The group should ask the professor if the idea that they want to realize is fine or not.
