# Oral and project exam

We should look for the topics on the moodle about the theoretical part and study **both from the slides and the book**.

For the **project** we make a p**roposal and we send it to him** (around 1 page). The project should cover several topics of the course.

The project should be submitted before the date that is written on the SOL page. The submission must include:

- the code
- some documentation
- test cases
- instructions to compile run and deploy the project (this could be contained also in a separate README file)

We should go into details about the architecture that we decided to design and the reasons behind it. We should also refer to the topics we covered during the course in particular. We should give the professor a good explanation of how he can appreciate our work.

He will evaluate the originality but also, the correctness of the design and the quality of the report that we provide. The **project includes the report**, it's not something marginal. A bad documentation will lead to a project with a lower grade.

Plagiarism is not tolerated.

Libraries can be used but should be well explained in the report so that he can understand that we know what we are using them for.
